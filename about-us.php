                            <p class="hist-para">Lanka Transformers Ltd was set up as a joint venture between Ceylon Electricity Board and Bonar Long of Scotland in 1980. The sole objective of setting up of the company was to have the technology of transformer manufacture be available to CEB within the country and thereby have a high quality, locally manufactured transformer for the electricity distribution system of Sri Lanka with reliable supply and after sales service. In 1982 CEB invested Rs. 8.5 M to acquire 70% stake of the new company.
