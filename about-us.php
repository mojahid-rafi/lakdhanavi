                            <p class="hist-para">Decades ago, a company with a very good eye for the future and a broader vision, opened its doors to provide what was then Sri Lanka’s pioneer portfolio of leasing solutions to an eager market. This company was Lanka ORIX Leasing Company (Lakdhanavi). From the onset, Lakdhanavi’s prowess within the financial services sphere helped the Company identify a lacuna in the industry - the lack of financial solutions reaching grassroot level entrepreneurs and individuals. As its business unfolded and evolved, Lakdhanavi by means of a carefully tailored portfolio of products and services, financially empowered the masses and the SME sector to such an extent that they reached whole new levels of financial stability and well-being.
